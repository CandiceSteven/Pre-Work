The man went to his SUV and retrieved a firearm, which he fired in Bugz's direction. Bugz was shot four times and was hit by the assailant's vehicle as the attacker fled the scene. After Bugz's death, Eminem volunteered as replacement to fulfill the group's forthcoming obligations. This led to Eminem eventually rejoining the group.</i>

         Marshall Mathers, a rapper who mostly grew up in Detroit, has consistently been one of the most influential and best rappers in the game. Rolling Stone even ranked him in the “100 Greatest Artists of All Time.” Some have labeled him as the “King of Hip Hop.” Throughout much of his childhood, Eminem grew up in a working-class predominantly black neighborhood in Detroit. Eminem rarely had a stable home life because he often fought with his mother. While he worked several jobs and helped to support his mother, he says that she often threw him out of the home anyway.

         Although at the time rap music was almost exclusively produced by Black people, Eminem, who has pale white skin and bright blue eyes, nevertheless entered into the Detroit rap scene as a frequent competitor in rap "battles"—competitions in which two rappers take turns insulting the other through improvised rap lyrics. Eminem proved highly skilled at such verbal sparring and, despite his race, quickly became one of the most respected figures in Detroit's underground rap scene.
    </p>
    <p>
         Eminem went on to become one of the most acclaimed rappers in the genre's brief history. As much as any other individual artist, he is responsible for rap's transformation into a mainstream music genre.
